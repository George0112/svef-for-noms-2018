		Filter the NAL units that have unsatisfied dependencies and emulate a

		SVC Medium Grain Scalability version.

		Usage: %s <sent stream trace file> <received trace file> <play out buffer in 
		milliseconds> <frames per second>  >   <filtered trace file>
		
		Where:

		<sent stream trace file>: the trace file obtained from the "-pt" option
		of the JSVM BitstreamExtractor tool using the sent H.264 as the
		argument, or from the purgeLastGOP.py script. For example:
		$ BitstreamExtractorStatic -pt originaltrace.txt foreman.264
		$ purgeLastGOP.py originaldecoderoutput.txt originaltrace.txt > originaltrace-nolastgop.txt

		<received trace file>: the trace file obtained from the /receiver/
		module. For example:
		$ ./receiver 4455 out.264 20000 > receivedtrace.txt

		<play out buffer in milliseconds>: the length of the play-out buffer.

		<frames per second>: fps for the processed video.

		Example:
		%s originaltrace-nolastgop.txt receivedtrace.txt 5000 30 > filteredtrace.txt
